## 🚀 The Challenge: $0 Software Budget
Industrial automation often requires expensive licenses (like Siemens TIA Portal). This project was developed to overcome financial barriers by creating a full-scale **SCADA System** using only open-source tools. We managed to control an entire factory remotely from miles away with zero software costs.

## ✨ Key Features
* **Remote Control:** Manage PLC operations from miles away via a secure connection.
* **Real-time Synchronization:** Millisecond-level latency between the factory floor and the dashboard.
* **Dual Interface:** * **Desktop:** Python/Tkinter dashboard for comprehensive monitoring.
  * **Mobile:** Java-based Android app for on-the-go control.
* **Cost Effective:** Built entirely with free tools and libraries.

---

## 🛠️ Technical Stack
* **Backend & Desktop UI:** Python 3.x (Tkinter for Industrial UI).
* **Mobile App:** Java / Android SDK.
* **Communication Protocols:** [e.g., Snap7 / Modbus TCP / MQTT].
* **Industrial Integration:** Compatible with Siemens S7 series and other PLCs.
